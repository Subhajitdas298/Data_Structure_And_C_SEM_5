## Install C/C++ Compilers & IDE
### Linux
#### Option 1 :
No need to install any software.  
Open command prompt (usual shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`). 

Step 1 : Write your code in any text editor (Ex. `gedit`). And save the file with `.c` extension and no space in file name.  
Step 2 : Compile using `gcc` (Ex. `gcc mycode.c`).  
Step 3 : Run the executable `a.out` file (Ex. `./a.out`).

#### Option 2 :
Install IDE (we are using CodeBlocks here).  
Open command prompt (usual shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`).  

Note : You have to go through Step 1 to Step 3 only once to install latest codeblocks.  
Step 1 : Run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:damien-moore/codeblocks-stable` command. Enter password of pc if asked. And press enter when asked.  
Step 2 : Run `sudo apt update`.  
Step 3 : Run `sudo apt install codeblocks`.  
Step 4 : Open `codeblocks`.  
Step 5 : Go to New->Wmpty File-> Write your code.  
Step 5 : Go to save your code with `.c` extension.  
Step 6 : Click on build and run to execute your program.  

### Windows
Install IDE (we are using CodeBlocks here).  

Step 1 : install codeblocks from [Sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe).  
Step 2 : Open `codeblocks`.  
Step 3 : Go to New->Wmpty File-> Write your code.
